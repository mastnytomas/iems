Run project: npm start

If I had more time, I would:
Better page layout.
Dialog to confirm employee deletion in Detail.
Possibility to import test data (see EMPLOYEE_TEST_DATA).
Ability to filter and sort the data in the table. (I would implement it so that each filter/sort would be automatically written into the url as a parameter, for easy sharing of the exact filtered tables between colleagues for example.) (The filtered part of the name/email would be highlighted).
Possibility to export data to csv/json for example.
Indicator of the total number of employees and an overview of how many are in a certain position and working time.
Add another icon to the table in Actions to show Detail with edit mode immediately enabled.
Add a copy icon to the email in the table and in the Detail, and when pressed it would write the address to the user's copy box.
Adding a SnackBar that would let you know what things have been done. (Snackbar informing about employee deletion or creation, or application errors).

Total time on the project: 4h15min
