Junior React Developer Coding Challenge

The target of this challenge is verification of candidate’s skills in frontend software development
using React and TypeScript.

It is not necessary to finish all functional requirements. Try to implement the task in the quality you
believe is sufficient to call an assignment “done”.

The time spent should not exceed 4 hours. We are interested in seeing how much can be done in
such limited time frame and we don’t want you to spend too much time on this. Document all the
changes you would normally continue with, had you more time.
Task

Acme Corporation is working on an internal employee management system. The system is going to
be used by HR staff to track details about company employees.
Your task is to create a first version of the app which allows HR staff to manage employees in the
system. Since the backend part of the system does not exist yet, the app should be able to store its
data in browser storage but it should also allow switching the storage for backend API calls easily.
Optionally, create OpenAPI specs of REST API supporting all use cases.

Employee data:
• Full name
• Company email address
• Job position: frontend developer, backend developer, tester or system architect
• Working time: full-time or part-time

Functional Requirements
• Create a new employee using a form
• List existing employee including all their details in a table

Non-Functional Requirements
• Use React+TypeScript
• Store data in browser storage
• Implement storage so that it is easy to replace its implementation by API calls
• Do not spend too much time with visual styling, optionally use Bootstrap
• Do not implement any authentication
• Use npm to manage dependencies
• Use npm scripts to run the app (npm ci & npm start)
Generally, keep it simple.

Documentation Requirements
• All tasks which you would normally do but did not have enough time
• Time spent
Delivery Instructions
• Private GitHub / BitBucket / GitLab / Gitea repository
• Use version control workflow (we are interested in seeing commit history)
